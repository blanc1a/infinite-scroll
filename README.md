# Infinite Scroll

This project is an exercise from the Zero to Mastery course. The goal is to create an infinite scroll web application using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Unsplash API is used to fetch and display images, enabling the user to scroll infinitely. If the images are not loaded quickly enough, a loader is shown. Clicking on an image redirects the user to the respective image on Unsplash. Additionally, I've enhanced the responsiveness of the site beyond what was required in the exercise.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **HTML**
